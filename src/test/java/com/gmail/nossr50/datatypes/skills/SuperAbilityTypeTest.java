/**
 * The coupling that {@link SuperAbilityType#SECOND_WIND}'s <b>nominal</b> sub-skill binding rests on.
 *
 * <p>Second Wind is the one super ability with three sub-skills — {@code PARKOUR_SECOND_WIND},
 * {@code SWIMMING_SECOND_WIND} and {@code FLYING_SECOND_WIND}, one per medium, because a sub-skill's
 * parent is derived from its enum name prefix and no single constant can span three parents. It is
 * still <em>one</em> ability with one cooldown, so {@code subSkillTypeDefinition} can only name one
 * of the three, and it names Parkour's.
 *
 * <p>That single answer is correct for every medium <b>only because all three unlock at the same
 * level.</b> This class is the "and a test says so" that the comment on that binding promises.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ <b>Written 2026-08-17, one phase late.</b> The binding shipped carrying a comment naming this
 * exact class and method, and the class did not exist — a comment that names its own test is not
 * evidence the test exists. Rank plumbing here is the real {@link RankConfig} loaded from the bundled
 * {@code skillranks.yml}, so what is asserted is what ships rather than a mock.
 *
 * <p><b>Not here:</b> "every super ability has a non-null binding" is NOT a property of this enum —
 * five abilities are deliberate placeholders with no sub-skill at all. That distinction, and the
 * non-null assertion over the <em>implemented</em> ones, lives in {@code PlaceholderSuperAbilityTest},
 * which derives the placeholder set instead of hand-keeping it. Asserting it again here was tried and
 * was simply wrong.
