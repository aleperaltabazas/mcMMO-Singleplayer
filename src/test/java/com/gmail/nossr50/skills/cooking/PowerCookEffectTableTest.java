/**
 * The shipped {@code Skills.Cooking.Power_Cook_Effects} table, audited against the item and status
 * effect registries rather than against anybody's memory of them.
 *
 * <p><b>This class exists because the table's failure modes are config edits, not code edits</b>, and
 * no other test in the suite covers that direction. Every rule Power Cook is built on lives in a
 * YAML file an operator can change, and each one is silent when broken:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>⚠️⚠️ <b>an effect that fires every tick.</b> Three rows once mapped Saturation, which
 *       {@code InstantMobEffect} applies <em>per tick for its whole duration</em> — 3 seconds of
 *       it is +60 food onto a 20-point bar, from one slice of bread, forever. The check is
 *       {@code canApplyUpdateEffect(1, 0)}, <b>never {@code instanceof InstantMobEffect}</b>:
 *       four of the seven per-tick effects in the registry are not subclasses of it, so the
 *       obvious spelling of this test passes {@code hunger}, {@code absorption}, {@code bad_omen}
 *       and {@code raid_omen} straight through;</li>
 *   <li>a misspelled effect name, which silently disables the row;</li>
 *   <li>a food that is not edible — the four fish buckets, which the eat seam can never fire for;</li>
 *   <li>a food vanilla already gives an effect to, which would stack two effects on one bite;</li>
 *   <li>Fire Resistance or Water Breathing, which are banned outright at any duration.</li>
 * </ul>
