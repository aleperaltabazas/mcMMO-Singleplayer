/**
 * Pins {@link PlatformPlayer#rebind} — the fix for a session-long stale-handle bug.
 *
 * <p>A {@link PlatformPlayer} is built once per login and handed to the player's {@code McMMOPlayer},
 * every skill manager, and every scheduled ability task. But vanilla's
 * {@code PlayerManager#respawnPlayer} does not reuse the {@link ServerPlayer}: it calls
 * {@code ServerWorld.removePlayer(old, reason)} and constructs a replacement (bytecode-verified
 * against 1.21.11), on both the death path and the End-exit path. Without a rebind, every MC-typed
 * call for the rest of the session — sounds, notifications, main-hand reads, the Super/Giga Breaker
 * dig-boost sweep — targets a removed entity and silently does nothing.
 *
 * <p>Runs under the {@code fabric-loader-junit} registry harness because mocking a
 * {@link ServerPlayer} loads the entity class hierarchy.

     * <p>The mapping is eleven hand-written switch arms, and a copy-paste slip in any one of them
     * (say {@code case VOICE -> SoundSource.AMBIENT}) is completely silent: the sound still plays,
     * just on the wrong volume slider, which no other test and no boot check would notice.
     *
     * <p>So this asserts the <em>property</em> rather than re-listing the table: every platform
     * constant must map to the vanilla constant of the <b>same name</b>. Driving it from
     * {@code values()} — never a hard-coded list — is what makes it catch a newly added constant
     * too, and keeps it from going vacuous the way a table-driven guard does.
     *
     * <h2>⚠️ Not every band has every category, and skipping is how this would go vacuous</h2>
     * The mirror enum is a superset: a category vanilla adds later has no same-name constant on an
     * older band, so a blanket {@code SoundSource.valueOf(name)} throws rather than failing an
     * assertion. Those constants are covered by
     * {@link #aCategoryVanillaLacksFallsBackDeliberatelyRatherThanSilently} instead — and the count
     * check below is what stops "skip the ones vanilla lacks" from quietly becoming "skip
     * everything": every vanilla constant must still have been reached by name.
