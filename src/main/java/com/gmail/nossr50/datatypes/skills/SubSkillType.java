     * three, the same threshold unlocks roughly 3x sooner for a specialist -- Smash at 150 now wants
     * Parkour 150, where it used to want Parkour 450 from a player who neither swims nor flies. That
     * is the correction, not a side effect: gating a sprint-attack perk on a player's swimming was
     * the same defect GitHub #4 fixed for Roll.
