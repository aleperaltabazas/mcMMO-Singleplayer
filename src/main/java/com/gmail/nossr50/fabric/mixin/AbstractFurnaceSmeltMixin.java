/**
 * The K7 Smelting hooks. Vanilla fires no furnace events at all, so three of mcMMO's four furnace
 * behaviours are injected into the static {@code AbstractFurnaceBlockEntity#tick}, and routed through
 * {@link SmeltingListener}, which resolves the furnace's owner:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Smelting XP</b> — at the {@code craftRecipe} call. That call is only reached when a cook
 *       finishes (cook time hit its total and the output slot can accept the result), so it is the
 *       faithful analogue of the legacy {@code FurnaceSmeltEvent}. The injection point is the invoke
 *       itself (default shift = before), so the input slot ({@code INPUT_SLOT_INDEX = 0}) still holds
 *       the item being smelted — {@code craftRecipe} is what decrements it.</li>
 *   <li><b>Second Smelt</b> — at the {@code setLastRecipe} call immediately after it.
 *       {@code setLastRecipe} is called <i>only</i> on the branch where {@code craftRecipe} returned
 *       true (bytecode-verified), which makes it a free "the smelt succeeded" marker, and by then the
 *       result has been merged into the output slot ({@code OUTPUT_SLOT_INDEX = 2}) — exactly what
 *       the bonus item has to be added to. Splitting the two hooks this way is what lets the XP hook
 *       read the input and the bonus hook read the output.</li>
 *   <li><b>Fuel Efficiency</b> — the value returned by {@code getFuelTime}, which {@code tick} assigns
 *       straight into {@code litTimeRemaining} (and then {@code litTotalTime}, so the fuel gauge
 *       scales with it). It is reached only on the branch that starts a new burn, i.e. exactly when
 *       the legacy {@code FurnaceBurnEvent} fired. {@code getFuelTime} is protected and {@code tick}
 *       is static, so MixinExtras' {@link ModifyExpressionValue} is used rather than a
 *       {@code @Redirect} that would need an {@code @Invoker} just to call the original.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The fourth behaviour, <b>Understanding the Art</b>, rides a different method on the same class:
 * the private static {@code dropExperience}, whose {@code ExperienceOrbEntity#spawn} argument is the
 * furnace XP a player is about to collect. It is not part of {@code tick} — the trigger is a player
 * taking the result out, picked up by {@code FurnaceOutputSlotMixin}, which leaves the multiplier in
 * a thread-local for {@link #mcmmo$boostVanillaXp} to read.
 *
 * <p>Every injector carries {@code allow = 1}: each of these targets appears exactly once in its
 * target method today, and a silent second bind (say, if a future version calls {@code setLastRecipe}
 * on another branch) would double-apply the bonus rather than fail loudly. {@code defaultRequire = 1}
 * alone does not catch that — {@code require} is a minimum.
 *
 * <p>⚠️ {@code tick}'s world parameter has been spelled both {@code World} and {@link ServerWorld}
 * across versions, so the handlers narrow it explicitly rather than assuming a side. That narrowing is
 * also the client guard. {@code dropExperience} takes a {@link ServerWorld} outright and needs none.
 *
 * <p>🔑 A handler whose parameter list does not match its target method is refused at apply time,
 * exactly like an unresolvable {@code @At} — but {@code scripts/mixin-allow-audit.py} resolves only
 * the {@code @At} target, so that failure hides behind a green row. Gate 2 passing is not permission
 * to skip gate 1.
