/**
 * The K7 Fishing XP hook: awards base Fishing XP when a player reels in a catch (CONVERSION_TODO §B).
 * Replaces the XP slice of the legacy {@code PlayerListener} {@code CAUGHT_FISH} handler (which read
 * the Bukkit {@code PlayerFishEvent}).
 *
 * <p>Vanilla fires no fishing event, so this is driven by {@code fabric/mixin/FishingBobberUseMixin},
 * which injects at the {@code Criteria.FISHING_ROD_HOOKED.trigger} call inside
 * {@code FishingBobberEntity#use} and hands us the caught-loot {@code Collection<ItemStack>} plus the
 * bobber. That criterion also fires for the reel-in-a-hooked-entity branch, but there vanilla passes an
 * empty collection — so an empty catch is a graceful no-op, faithfully matching legacy (which only
 * processed the {@code CAUGHT_FISH} state, not {@code CAUGHT_ENTITY}).
 *
 * <p>The base XP is keyed on the caught item's material config string
 * ({@code minecraft:cod} → {@code "Cod"}) via {@code ExperienceConfig.getXp(FISHING, ...)}; the MC-free
 * award lives on {@link FishingManager#awardFishingXP(String)}. The legacy anti-exploit gating
 * (spam-throttle {@link FishingManager#isFishingTooOften()} and same-spot
 * {@link FishingManager#processExploiting}/{@link FishingManager#isExploitingFishing()}, both keyed on
 * {@code ExploitFix.Fishing}) is replicated here using the bobber's position.
 *
 * <p><b>Treasure Hunter loot is now wired</b> ({@link #maybeCatchTreasure}): after the base XP award,
 * we roll {@link FishingManager#rollFishingTreasure} and, on a hit, build the reward with
 * {@link ItemSpecBuilder} and inject it into the same caught-loot collection the mixin handed us — the
 * exact {@code ObjectArrayList} that {@code FishingBobberEntity#use} iterates to spawn the reeled-in
 * item entities (verified by bytecode), so the treasure flies to the player like a normal catch with no
 * bespoke entity-spawn glue. Faithful to legacy: with {@code Extra_Fish} off (the shipped default) the
 * treasure <i>replaces</i> the fish, with it on both are kept; the base catch XP is awarded either way.
 *
 * <p><b>Master Angler is also wired here</b> ({@link #resolveWaitCountdown}), driven by
 * {@code fabric/mixin/FishingWaitTimeMixin} — see that class for the seam. It replaces legacy's
 * {@code MasterAnglerTask}, which needed a scheduled task only because a Bukkit event handler could
 * not sit where the wait is actually drawn.
 *
 * <p><b>Shake is wired here too</b> ({@link #onEntityHooked}), driven by the second injector in
 * {@code FishingBobberUseMixin}: reeling in a hooked mob is legacy's {@code CAUGHT_ENTITY} state, and
 * a successful roll knocks a configured drop off the mob, damages it and pays flat Shake XP.
 *
 * <p><b>Magic Hunter is wired here too</b> ({@link #maybeApplyMagicHunter}): a caught treasure that is
 * enchantable can arrive enchanted, rolled off the {@code Enchantment_Drop_Rates} tier curve and the
 * {@code Enchantments_Rarity} table. See that method for the three MC-typed pieces it owns (dynamic
 * registry resolution, applicability filtering, and the unsafe enchant write).
 *
 * <p><b>Enchanted-book treasures are wired here too</b> ({@link #applyBookEnchantment}): a caught
 * {@link FishingTreasureBook} always arrives carrying one enchantment drawn from the whole registry
 * under its own whitelist/blacklist. It is a <i>different</i> mechanism from Magic Hunter, and the two
 * are mutually exclusive — see that method.
 *
 * <p><b>The overfishing punishment is wired</b> ({@link #punishOverfishing}): once a player is past the
 * {@code OverFishLimit} on one spot the catch is confiscated outright, on top of the XP and treasure
 * roll the exploit gate already skipped.

     * whitelist/blacklist — not from the curated Magic Hunter table, which this path never touches.
     *
     * <p>Three things need Minecraft here, and the rest is MC-free:
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li><b>Enumerating the registry.</b> Legacy walked {@code Enchantment.values()} at config
     *       load; 1.21's enchantment registry is dynamic (datapack-driven), so the walk moves here and
     *       reads the player's {@code DynamicRegistryManager}. That is also why the whitelist/blacklist
     *       are matched against live paths — see
     *       {@link FishingTreasureBook#resolveAllowedEnchantmentIds}, which reproduces legacy's
     *       drop-unknown-names-then-check-empty precedence.</li>
     *   <li><b>Expanding each allowed enchantment over its levels</b> ({@code 1..getMaxLevel()}), the
     *       weighting legacy's {@code legalEnchantments} list encodes — only the registry knows an
     *       enchantment's maximum level.</li>
     *   <li><b>Writing it as a <i>stored</i> enchantment.</b> {@code EnchantmentHelper} picks the
     *       component for us: its private {@code getEnchantmentsComponentType} is literally
     *       {@code isOf(ENCHANTED_BOOK) ? STORED_ENCHANTMENTS : ENCHANTMENTS} (bytecode-verified), and
     *       both {@code getEnchantments} and {@code set} route through it — so the same
     *       {@code ItemEnchantmentsComponent.Builder} surface Magic Hunter and Arcane Forging use
     *       writes a book's stored enchantment with no book/tool branch of our own. That is legacy's
     *       {@code EnchantmentStorageMeta#addStoredEnchant}.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p><b>Legacy's {@code allowUnsafeEnchantments} flag is inert on this path and is not read.</b>
     * Upstream passes it as {@code addStoredEnchant}'s {@code ignoreLevelRestriction} argument, but the
     * level always comes from the {@code 1..getMaxLevel()} expansion above, so the restriction it would
     * waive can never bind. (It is read where it does matter — Arcane Forging and Arcane Salvage, see
     * {@code RepairSalvageListener}.)
     *
     * <p>Unlike Magic Hunter there is no rank or sub-skill gate: the book is a Treasure Hunter reward
     * like any other, and the enchantment is part of what the reward <i>is</i>, so drawing it is not a
     * separate perk. Legacy likewise reaches this with no further check.
     *
     * <p><b>Known simplification:</b> the pool is keyed by registry <i>path</i>, with the namespace
     * dropped, because that is what the config's filters name — legacy matches on Bukkit's
     * {@code getKey().getKey()}, which is likewise the namespace-less key. If a mod ever registered an
     * enchantment whose path collides with a vanilla one ({@code somemod:fortune}), only one of the two
     * would reach the pool. Upstream would carry both and let the filter match either; the difference
     * is unreachable in this singleplayer port's vanilla registry and is not built for.
     *
     * @return whether an enchantment was applied (the caller sends the notification if so)

     * reconstructs the precondition without the private state: the bobber has no hooked entity (that is
     * the Shake path) and is <em>not</em> sitting in water (a bobbing/caught bobber is, a stuck-on-ice
     * one is not). Legacy resolved the ice block from {@code player.getTargetBlock(null, 100)} — the
     * player's crosshair, not the bobber — so this raycasts the player likewise.
     *
     * <p><b>Body-of-water check.</b> Legacy required the block 3 below to be water <em>or</em> an icy
     * biome. There is no stable vanilla "icy biome" tag, and a genuine frozen lake/ocean has water
     * within a few blocks of its surface regardless of biome, so this scans the 1–4 blocks under the ice
     * for water and drops the biome-OR shortcut (documented deviation; guards against melting a
     * decorative ice block with nothing beneath it). Legacy's {@code EventUtils.simulateBlockBreak}
     * protection probe is dropped on {@link FishingManager#canIceFish()} as elsewhere.
     *
     * <p><b>Deviation — no auto-recast.</b> Legacy recast the hook in place
     * ({@code EventUtils.callFakeFishEvent}) so the reel that melted the ice immediately dropped the line
     * into the new water. That needs bespoke bobber-spawn glue (a fresh {@code FishingBobberEntity} wired
     * to {@code player.fishHook}); it is deferred as a UX nicety. The reel still discards its bobber as
     * normal, so the player simply casts again into the fresh hole. <b>§G:</b> the whole path is
