/**
 * Every mcMMO block decision that can be made from a block's vanilla registry-id <em>path</em>
 * ({@code oak_log}) and a position key, with no Minecraft type anywhere in the signature. The
 * MC-typed bridge that extracts those keys from a live {@code Block}/{@code BlockState}/{@code World}
 * is {@code platform.BlockUtils}.
 *
 * <h2>Why this class exists (Phase 2, ruling P2-d)</h2>
 * The multi-version work seals {@code net.minecraft} out of everything except {@code fabric/} and
 * {@code platform/}. Relocating a file into {@code platform/} satisfies that boundary but does not
 * <em>shrink</em> it — the same lines still diverge per band, they just diverge somewhere else.
 * Only extraction shrinks it. Everything below is version-agnostic by construction: it reasons about
 * strings and longs, so it is byte-identical on every supported Minecraft band, and it is unit-testable
 * without the {@code fabric-loader-junit} harness (see {@code gradle-build-tuning}: {@code
 * Bootstrap.initialize()} costs ~53s per fork, which Phase 4.4 has to pay per band).
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ What deliberately did NOT move here</h2>
 * Two checks in the bridge are block <b>identity</b> comparisons, not id-path lookups —
 * {@code state.isOf(Blocks.SNOW)} in Berserk's insta-break set, and {@code formed == Blocks.OBSIDIAN}
 * in the lava gate. Re-expressing them as {@code "snow".equals(idPath)} would silently <em>broaden</em>
 * them to any namespace's block of that name. The store-backed whitelists this class delegates to are
 * already path-keyed and therefore already namespace-blind — that is the existing design and is not
 * relitigated here — but converting an exact check into a fuzzy one as a side effect of a refactor is
 * how semantics rot. Both stay on the MC side, one line each.
 *
 * <p>Also still MC-typed, because they read live block state rather than an identity: crop maturity
 * (the {@code age} property scan) and the two Hylian block-tag memberships — the latter reach this
 * class as {@link BooleanSupplier}s, see {@link #hylianTreasureGroup}.
 *
 * @see MaterialMapStore the hardcoded whitelists, keyed on the registry path
 * @see PlacedBlockTracker the placed-block flag store, keyed on (world key, packed position)
