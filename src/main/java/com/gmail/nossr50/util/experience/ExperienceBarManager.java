/**
 * Shows, refreshes, and auto-hides one player's mcMMO XP bars — one {@link ExperienceBar} per skill.
 *
 * <p>Legacy {@code ExperienceBarManager}, ported for singleplayer. Each XP gain calls
 * {@link #updateExperienceBar}, which shows/updates that skill's bar and (re)arms a hide task; the
 * bar fades once the player stops training that skill for {@code Hide_Delay_Seconds}
 * (default 10 — legacy hard-coded 3). Every time the player gains more XP in the same skill the
 * pending hide is cancelled and re-scheduled, so the bar only disappears after a real lull.
 *
 * <p>All Minecraft types are kept out of this class: the bar itself is the injected
 * {@link ExperienceBar} seam (real {@link ExperienceBarWrapper} in production, a fake in tests), the
 * timer is the MC-free {@link TaskScheduler}, and the enable/colour config is an injected
 * {@link ExperienceConfig}. That makes the show / re-arm / hide logic fully unit-testable with no
 * live server. One manager is created lazily per {@link McMMOPlayer}.
