/**
 * Whether a skill's subject matter exists in the Minecraft version this build is running against.
 *
 * <p>Distinct from {@link SkillGating}, which answers whether the <em>player</em> switched a skill
 * off (GitHub #10). This answers whether the skill could ever do anything here at all. Both feed
 * {@link SkillGating#isSkillEnabled}; only this one is beyond the player's control, which is why the
 * two stay separable and {@code /mcstats} can tell the player which of the two it hit.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists — the owner's ruling of 2026-08-11</h2>
 *
 * Spear items ship from a Minecraft version part-way through this project's supported range. Below
 * it, {@code SPEARS} is <em>inert</em> rather than broken — {@code MaterialMapStore#isSpear} matches
 * id paths that nothing in the registry has, so nothing ever classifies as a spear and the skill
 * never fires. The ruling is that inert is not good enough: the skill is still listed by
 * {@code /mcstats}, still in the configs, and can never leave level 0. It is to be <b>disabled</b>,
 * and not dropped from {@link PrimarySkillType}.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ Why this is a MAP and not one field per skill</h2>
 *
 * Spears was the first skill to need this and, for one release, the only one — so the gate was a
 * single {@code spearsSupported} field, justified in this javadoc by the claim that <i>"every other
 * skill's subject matter — ores, crops, mobs, the anvil — predates the floor of the supported
 * range."</i>
 *
 * <p><b>That sentence was load-bearing prose, and lowering the floor falsified it.</b>
 * {@code MACES} matches exactly one registry-id path, {@code "mace"}, so on a version without the
 * mace it is inert in precisely the way the Spears ruling exists to reject: listed by
 * {@code /mcstats}, present in the configs, permanently stuck at level 0.
 *
 * <p>A second hardcoded field would have made the next one a third, so the shape is a
 * <b>skill → required-id-paths</b> map instead. Adding a gate is one entry in {@link #GATED} and
 * nothing else: every consumer ({@code /mcstats}, the ModMenu master switches, {@link SkillGating})
 * already reads this through {@link #isSkillSupported} rather than by naming a skill.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️⚠️ Why this asks the registry instead of naming a version</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>A version-pinned constant is a claim no compiler and no test can check</b>, and this
 *       project has already shipped three of those (see {@code AGENTS.md}: <i>never pin a comment to
 *       the build's Minecraft version</i>). A hand-set per-band flag additionally has to be remembered
 *       on every band cut in future — the silent drift that branch-per-band exists in fear of.
 *       "Does this registry have a spear in it" is one expression that is correct on every band from
 *       one source tree and needs no maintenance when the next band is cut.</li>
 *   <li><b>A shipped config default cannot implement this ruling.</b> {@code copyMissingDefaults}
 *       back-fills only <em>absent</em> keys, so flipping {@code Spears.Enabled} in the jar's
 *       {@code coreskills.yml} reaches nobody who has already run the mod once on that band. The gate
 *       has to hold regardless of what is on disk, so it lives in code and is ANDed with the config
 *       rather than written into it.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ Probed once, explicitly — never lazily off the first caller</h2>
 *
 * {@link #probe()} runs from {@code McMMOMod#onServerStarting}, the first point at which the item
 * registry is certainly populated. Until it runs, every skill reads as supported.
 *
 * <p>That is deliberate, and the alternative was tried first: a lazy probe on the first
 * {@link #isSkillSupported} call has to treat "the registry is empty" as "cannot tell yet", and in
 * the test suite whether the registry is populated depends on <em>which Gradle fork a test class
 * landed in</em> — a class sharing a fork with a {@code McTestRegistries.bootstrap()} sees a live
 * registry, one that does not, sees an empty one. On a band without spears that turns every
 * Spears assertion in the suite into a coin flip decided by test scheduling. An explicit probe has
 * one answer per process and nothing infers anything from an absence it did not ask for.
