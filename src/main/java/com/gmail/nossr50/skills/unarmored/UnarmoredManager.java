/**
 * Unarmored — the skill for people who fight in their shirt. XP comes from being hit while every
 * armour slot is empty; the payoff is innate "skin" armour that grows through four tiers
 * (Iron Skin) and a small retaliatory sting (Thorny Skin).
 *
 * <p><b>MC-free by construction</b>, like every other manager. The platform layer decides
 * <em>whether</em> the player is unarmored and who hit them; this class owns the arithmetic and the
 * gates, so all of it is unit-testable.
 *
 * <h2>The one rule the whole skill hangs off</h2>
 * Every payoff here takes an {@code unarmored} boolean and returns zero when it is {@code false}.
 * That is the skill's entire premise — it rewards going without armour — and expressing it as a
 * parameter rather than as a caller-side {@code if} means a caller cannot forget the check and
 * quietly hand a fully-plated player free armour points.
 *
 * <h2>Design rulings (see {@code plans/new-skills/unarmored.md})</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>D-U1 — the "doubles real armour" clause is CUT.</b> The source wiki says the skin applies
 *       "when not wearing armor" and then that real armour is "doubled"; those contradict, and only
 *       the first is the skill. A wearing-armour synergy would be a different skill.</li>
 *   <li><b>D-U2 — stepped tiers, not continuous scaling.</b> The four ranks of
 *       {@link SubSkillType#UNARMORED_IRON_SKIN} <em>are</em> the four tiers, so the rank number
 *       indexes the armour table directly and there is no second set of breakpoint levels in
 *       {@code advanced.yml} to drift out of step with {@code skillranks.yml}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Armour points only, no toughness.</b> Toughness is what blunts <em>large</em> hits, so
 *       withholding it is what keeps a real armour set worth wearing: diamond skin (20 armour, 0
 *       toughness) still takes noticeably more from a heavy blow than a diamond set (20 armour, 8
 *       toughness), and real armour keeps its enchantments on top.</li>
 * </ul>
