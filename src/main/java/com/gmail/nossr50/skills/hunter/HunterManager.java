/**
 * Hunter — the mob-knowledge skill. The more of one creature you have personally killed, the better
 * you get at killing <em>that</em> creature.
 *
 * <p><b>MC-free by construction</b>, like every other manager: this class owns the arithmetic and the
 * gates, the platform layer decides what died and who killed it.
 *
 * <h2>Two axes, deliberately independent</h2>
 * <table>
 *   <caption>Hunter's two progression axes</caption>
 *   <tr><th>Axis</th><th>Currency</th><th>Reward</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td><b>Mob mastery</b> (horizontal)</td><td>kills of <em>one</em> mob type</td>
 *       <td>flat bonus damage against that mob only, at three fixed thresholds, never reset</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td><b>Hunter level</b> (vertical)</td><td>XP from any qualifying kill</td>
 *       <td>increased loot, unlocked per mob tier, on the normal {@code 10N² + 1010N} curve</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>Killing 10,000 zombies makes you a zombie specialist; killing 200 of everything makes you a
 * generalist with better drops. Neither substitutes for the other, and that separation is the reason
 * the skill is worth building — it must survive any balance pass intact.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ Mob Mastery does not fit {@code RankUtils}, and must not be forced through it</h2>
 * Every other sub-skill in the mod unlocks on <em>skill level</em> via {@code skillranks.yml}.
 * Mastery unlocks on a <em>per-mob counter</em>, which no rank config can express — so the tier
 * resolver lives here, on the manager. Routing it through {@code RankUtils} would produce a sub-skill
 * whose rank display lies.
 *
 * <h2>Scope as of stage 7 — the skill is complete</h2>
 * Both axes: the kill counters and the threshold arithmetic they feed (with the bonus damage a tier
 * is worth), the mob-tier rule with the XP each tier pays, Trophy Hunter's per-tier unlock and
 * chance, and the reporting arithmetic the two screens need.
 *
 * <p>{@link #masteryDamageBonusForHit} is spent by {@code EntityDamageListener#applyHunterMastery},
 * which runs <b>last</b> in that chain — after Sprint Smash and after Stealth Assassin — because
 * Assassin multiplies the whole melee total, so a Hunter bonus applied first would be multiplied
 * along with it. {@link #awardKillXp} is spent by {@code HunterListener} and
 * {@link #rollTrophyDrop} by {@code LivingEntityTrophyHunterMixin} through
 * {@code HunterListener#onLootDropped}, all three behind the same four gates.
 * {@link #killsToNextMasteryTier}, {@link #masteredCreatureCount} and {@link #topKills} exist for
 * D-HU7's two windows onto the invisible horizontal axis — {@code HunterStatsRenderer} and Quarry
 * Sense's in-world readout ({@code EntityDamageListener#quarrySenseLore}).
 *
 * <p><b>Field Dressing is not here and that is deliberate</b>, not an omission: D-HU6 ruled it the
 * upgrade path to be taken only if §G finds a proportional loot re-roll unsatisfying, and it needs
 * loot-table introspection the port does not have.
 *
 * @see <a href="file:../../../../../../../plans/new-skills/hunter.md">plans/new-skills/hunter.md</a>
