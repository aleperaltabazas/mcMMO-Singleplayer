/**
 * Static helpers backing the Archery skill. Port note (Phase 10.3): only the Skill Shot damage math
 * survives here — it is pure config + rank arithmetic and therefore provable without a server.
 *
 * <p>Since then the <b>Arrow Retrieval tracker</b> has landed here too (see {@link
 * #incrementTrackerValue}/{@link #arrowRetrievalCheck}). Legacy kept it as a
 * {@code Map<UUID, TrackedEntity>} whose values were <em>scheduled runnables</em>: each
 * {@code TrackedEntity} held a live Bukkit {@code LivingEntity} and re-ran every 12000 ticks purely to
 * notice the entity had become invalid and evict itself. That whole class collapses to an {@code int}
 * on the shared {@link MetadataStore} side-table, which is already keyed by entity {@link UUID} — the
 * same substitution Rupture made for legacy's {@code RuptureTaskMeta}. Keeping the count MC-free (a
 * bare UUID rather than a platform entity) is what lets the increment/consume cycle be unit-tested
 * without the Knot harness.
 *
 * <p>Known deviation from legacy's eviction runnable: a tracked mob that despawns without dying keeps
 * its (few bytes of) count until {@link MetadataStore#clearAll()} runs at server stop, whereas legacy
 * evicted it within 12000 ticks. The counterpart is a small behavioural <em>improvement</em>: legacy
 * dropped the count when the entity merely unloaded with its chunk, so a player who shot a mob, walked
 * away and came back lost the arrows they had earned; here the count survives until the mob dies.
 *
 * <p>Config statics were made live reads: the legacy class cached
 * {@code skillShotMaxBonusDamage}/{@code DISTANCE_XP_MULTIPLIER} in {@code static final} fields at
 * class-load, which is fragile in the port where the config is installed into the {@link McMMOMod}
 * service locator after the fact. Values are now pulled on demand.
 *
 * <p>The <b>fired-from distance bonus</b> now lives here too (see {@link #markFiredFrom} /
 * {@link #distanceXpBonusMultiplier}), unblocked by the move to per-hit combat XP (see
 * {@link com.gmail.nossr50.platform.CombatUtils#processCombatXP}) — it is a per-hit XP multiplier
 * and had nothing to multiply while the port paid per kill. Legacy stamped a Bukkit {@code Location}
 * on the arrow's metadata; the MC-free equivalent is {@link FiredFrom}, which carries exactly the two
 * things the multiplier asks of that Location — its world, and its coordinates. Keeping it MC-free is
 * what lets the whole stamp→measure cycle be unit-tested outside the Knot harness, and is why legacy's
 * {@code ArcheryManager.distanceXpBonusMultiplier} (a {@code static} needing no player) lands on this
 * class rather than the manager.
