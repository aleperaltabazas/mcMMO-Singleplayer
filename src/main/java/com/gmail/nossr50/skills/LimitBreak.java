/**
 * Limit Break: the flat per-rank damage bonus every one of the eight combat skills carries
 * (legacy {@code CombatUtils#canUseLimitBreak} + {@code getLimitBreakDamage}). Server-free, so the
 * arithmetic is unit-testable; the call sites are {@link MeleeDamageBonus} for the six melee weapons
 * and {@code fabric.listeners.EntityDamageListener} for the three projectile arms.
 *
 * <h2>Why the armour-quality table is gone</h2>
 * Legacy nerfs the bonus against a lightly-armoured <em>player</em> — 75% off at armour tier ≤4, 50%
 * at ≤8, 25% at ≤12 — and passes a sentinel quality of {@code 1000} for anything that is not a
 * player, which skips all three tiers. In singleplayer the target is <b>never</b> a player, so only
 * the sentinel branch is reachable and the bonus is always the un-nerfed rank. The table and its
 * {@code getArmorQualityLevel}/{@code getArmorQuality} helpers are collapsed away rather than ported
 * as an unreachable branch — the same honest collapse made for Disarm, Iron Grip and
 * {@code CombatUtils#shouldBeAffected}'s player arm. Porting a branch nothing can enter is how the
 * §F dead-code defects were made.
 *
 * <p>The practical consequence is worth stating plainly, because it is the whole balance story:
 * <b>PVE receives the full bonus, not a nerfed one.</b> Rank N grants +N raw damage, and the ranks
 * unlock every 10 levels, so a level-100 weapon skill adds +10 per hit — more than a diamond sword's
 * base 7.
 *
 * <h2>The gate, and why "off" means invisible rather than merely inert</h2>
 * Legacy allows Limit Break against a mob only when {@code Skills.General.LimitBreak.AllowPVE} is
 * set, and that key ships {@code false}. In a game with no other players that means "off, always" —
 * which is exactly why the port previously shipped eight rank plaques announcing eight mechanics
 * that could never fire (TODO.md item 3.1). <b>It stays off by default</b>, because the un-nerfed
 * PVE bonus is a large power increase and that should be the player's choice, not a surprise.
 *
 * <p>What changed is that "off" is now honest. {@link #isEnabled()} is consulted by three surfaces,
 * not one:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>this class, so no damage is added;</li>
 *   <li>{@code SkillStatsRenderer}, so {@code /mcstats} does not list a sub-skill the player cannot
 *       use; and</li>
 *   <li>{@code McMMOPlayer#rankedSubSkillsOf}, so no "You can now use Swords Limit Break." plaque
 *       toasts for it.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Wiring the damage alone would have left the original defect exactly as it was — a dead mechanic
 * with a live surface — merely with the switch moved. <b>A toggle that silences the mechanic but not
 * its advertising is not a fix.</b>
