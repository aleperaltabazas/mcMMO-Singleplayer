/**
 * Agility skill manager. Both the <b>Roll / Graceful Roll</b> fall-damage path (K2) and the
 * <b>Dodge</b> combat path (K1) are live, driven by the {@code modifyAppliedDamage} damage mixin via
 * {@link com.gmail.nossr50.fabric.listeners.EntityDamageListener}. The Dodge XP anti-farm cap
 * (per-mob dodge tracker) and the lightning-dodge exclusion live in the listener (the MC-typed layer,
 * which has the attacker entity); this manager takes the attacker's XP-eligibility as a boolean so its
 * damage-reduction + XP math stays deterministic and unit-testable.
 *
 * <p>Port note: the legacy Roll logic lived in the {@code AbstractSubSkill}-based
 * {@code datatypes.skills.subskills.agility.Roll}, tightly coupled to Bukkit's
 * {@code EntityDamageEvent}. It is folded into this manager MC-free: the RNG orchestration
 * ({@link #processFallDamage}) is verified in-game, while the deterministic pieces
 * ({@link #rollCheck}, {@link #calculateRollXP}, the exploit gate, and the fall-location throttle)
 * are unit-testable. Sound/notification feedback is emitted by the listener (the MC-typed layer), not
 * here, so this class imports no Minecraft types.
 *
 * <p><b>This manager belongs to no single skill, and that is the whole point of it.</b> It hosts
 * every Parkour, Swimming and Flying sub-skill. Until 2026-08-17 that was expressed by keying it on
 * the {@code AGILITY} child skill, whose level was the mean of the three; {@code AGILITY} is now
 * retired and the manager is keyed <em>nominally</em> on {@code PARKOUR} (ruling A-8).
 *
 * <p>⚠️ <b>The inherited {@link SkillManager#skill} field is load-bearing for nothing here, and it
 * must stay that way.</b> Every XP award names its destination explicitly rather than going through
 * {@link SkillManager#applyXpGain} — travel pays the medium's own skill
 * ({@link Medium#primarySkill()}), falling and dodging pay {@link #EPISODIC_XP_SKILL} — and all four
 * level ramps pass an explicit skill to {@code scaleToLevel}. Reaching for the inherited
 * {@code getSkillLevel()} or the two-argument {@code scaleToLevel} would silently scale a swimmer's
 * or a flier's perk on their <em>Parkour</em> level. That is the same defect shape phase C found
 * four times over, when those ramps still read the mean.
