/**
 * Cooking skill manager (Pass 2). Holds the MC-free half of every food-processing behaviour; the
 * MC-typed half (reading furnace slots, the crafting result slot, and the eaten stack) lives on the
 * existing {@code fabric.listeners.SmeltingListener} / {@code CookingListener} / {@code FoodListener}
 * seams.
 *
 * <p>Each behaviour lands with the seam that drives it:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Stage 2</b> ✅ — cook XP (the food branch of {@code onFurnaceSmelt}) and crafted-food XP
 *       ({@code CraftingResultSlot}), plus the {@code Max_Cooks_Per_Hour} rolling cap;</li>
 *   <li><b>Stage 3</b> ✅ — Kitchen Efficiency ({@link #boostFuelTime}, the {@code else} of the gate
 *       {@code boostFuelTime} has enforced since the Smelting port) and Master Chef
 *       ({@link #canSecondHelping}, the food arm of {@code onSmeltComplete});</li>
 *   <li><b>Stage 4</b> ✅ — Power Cook ({@link #powerCookEffect}, the eat seam; the level → duration
 *       math lives here precisely so it is unit-testable with no world);</li>
 *   <li><b>Stage 5</b> — campfires and {@code CookingStatsRenderer}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ Two key spaces, and they are deliberately not one</h2>
 * The two XP hooks read <b>different items</b> and therefore address <b>different config sections</b>:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #onCook} is handed the furnace's <b>input</b> — {@code beef}, {@code potato},
 *       {@code kelp} — because vanilla's {@code craftRecipe} is what decrements it, and the existing
 *       furnace seam injects <em>before</em> that call. Priced under
 *       {@code Experience_Values.Cooking.Cook}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onCraft} is handed the crafting grid's <b>result</b> — {@code bread}, {@code cookie},
 *       {@code dried_kelp}. Priced under {@code Experience_Values.Cooking.Craft}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Do not flatten these into one section.</b> {@code dried_kelp} is exactly why: smoking a
 * {@code kelp} is a legitimate 60-XP cook, while <em>crafting</em> a {@code dried_kelp} out of a
 * dried kelp block and crafting the block straight back is a free infinite loop that must price
 * <b>0</b>. The same item, two verbs, two prices — and the split is what makes that structural
 * rather than a coincidence of vanilla's recipe names.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ The per-skill disable switch, sub-skill by sub-skill</h2>
 * {@code SkillGating} enforces the {@code coreskills.yml} master switch at three chokepoints:
 * {@code Permissions}, {@code RankUtils} booleans, and {@code ProbabilityUtil#isSkillRNGSuccessful}.
 * The plan's standing warning is that a <em>multiplier</em> or a <em>deterministic effect</em>
 * reaches none of them, so each needs its own gate. Where that lands per sub-skill:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Master Chef</b> — an RNG proc. Covered twice over, and free.</li>
 *   <li><b>Kitchen Efficiency</b> — a multiplier, and the warning's headline case. It is covered
 *       anyway <em>because {@link #boostFuelTime} opens on {@link Permissions#isSubSkillEnabled}</em>,
 *       which is itself one of the three chokepoints. Routing through a chokepoint is the gate; the
 *       reasoning "a multiplier is not covered" is about the shape, not about this call. Asserted by
 *       a test rather than argued, because that is the only form of this claim worth anything.</li>
 *   <li><b>Power Cook</b> — a deterministic effect on the eat seam, and the plan's other headline
 *       case for an explicit call. It resolved the same way Kitchen Efficiency did:
 *       {@link #powerCookEffect} opens on {@link Permissions#isSubSkillEnabled}, so it is gated
 *       without one. <b>Routing through a chokepoint is the gate</b>, and a second redundant call
 *       would be a line no test could distinguish from its own absence.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The XP on this class needs no such call: every award goes through
 * {@code SkillManager#applyXpGain} → {@code McMMOPlayer#beginXpGain}, which GitHub #10 already gates.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ The Smelting boundary</h2>
 * Cooking and Smelting share the furnace and the shared {@code FURNACE_OWNERS} map, and the boundary
 * between them is already enforced in shipped code in both directions:
 * {@code Experience_Values.Smelting} lists ore only, and {@code SmeltingManager#boostFuelTime} gates
 * on {@code isSmeltable(input)} so that food burns at vanilla speed. Kitchen Efficiency is literally
 * the {@code else} of a gate that already exists — do not widen either side to "unify" them.
