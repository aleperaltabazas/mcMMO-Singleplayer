/**
 * Husbandry — the livestock lifecycle skill. XP comes from six verbs spanning an animal's whole life
 * under your care: breed it, raise it to adulthood, feed a baby along, shear it, harvest its hive,
 * and milk or brush it.
 *
 * <p><b>MC-free by construction</b>, like every other manager. The platform layer decides
 * <em>which</em> verb happened and to <em>what</em> animal; this class owns the pricing, so all of it
 * is unit-testable.
 *
 * <h2>The boundary against Taming — read this before adding anything</h2>
 * <b>The line is the verb, never the species.</b> A species split is not even available: the shipped
 * {@code Experience_Values.Taming.Animal_Taming} table already claims every animal in the game, down
 * to bees and goats you cannot actually tame. So:
 *
 * <blockquote><b>Taming pays once, for making an animal yours. Husbandry pays repeatedly, for what
 * you do with it afterwards.</b></blockquote>
 *
 * Breeding a tamed wolf pays Husbandry at the full rate — the verb owns it, not the species.
 * Feeding a wolf to heal it stays Taming ({@code TAMING_FAST_FOOD_SERVICE}); healing <em>in
 * combat</em> is the discriminator. Any sub-skill that fails that test does not ship.
 *
 * <h2>Why breeding is a per-species table and the rest are flat</h2>
 * Breeding costs whatever the animal's breeding item costs, and that spans two orders of magnitude —
 * chicken seeds are free, a horse eats golden carrots, a sniffer needs a torchflower seed dug out of
 * suspicious sand. Paying one flat rate would make the cheapest animal in the game the only one
 * worth breeding. The harvest verbs have no such spread: a shear is a shear.
 *
 * <p><b>An unpriced species pays nothing</b>, deliberately — the table <em>is</em> the definition of
 * what this skill rewards, exactly as {@code Animal_Taming} is for Taming, so a mob added by a future
 * version or another mod cannot silently start paying a number nobody chose.
 *
 * <h2>Stage 0</h2>
 * This class prices the six verbs and nothing else. No mechanic calls it yet; the trigger layer and
 * the sub-skills land in stages 1–6 (see {@code plans/new-skills/husbandry.md}). The pricing ships
 * first, alone, because it is the part with no Minecraft in it at all.

     *
     * <h2>Why the cap moved off the breeding and onto the payout (GitHub #3, 2026-08-04)</h2>
     * Until now the gate was {@code MultiBreed.MaxAdditionalAnimals}, a ceiling of four on how many
     * animals one breeding item could set in love. It had two problems and the second one is fatal:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>It taxed the <em>mechanic</em> rather than the reward. The sub-skill's whole appeal is
     *       feeding the pen from where you stand, and a cap of four meant walking to the rest of the
     *       herd anyway — which is what the issue reports as painful.</li>
     *   <li><b>It never actually bounded the XP rate.</b> It bounded XP <em>per item</em>, and wheat
     *       is free. Twenty clicks in one breath set a hundred animals in love and paid every one of
     *       the resulting fifty breedings, so the exploit the cap was written against — a big pen and
     *       a wheat farm — went straight through it.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * A cap counted <em>per unit of time</em> closes that, because time is the one input a farm
     * cannot manufacture. It is also the same shape the port has reached for twice already:
     * Unarmored's per-attacker award cap and Agility's Dodge cap both bound the award rather than the
     * mechanic.
     *
     * <p><b>Eight, doubled from the old four</b>, per the issue. At the shipped cow price of 350 that
     * is 336,000 XP/h sustained — comfortably above the skill's ~51 h design budget, so the cap does
     * not bite a player breeding by hand or working a normal pen. It bites only the loop that repeats
     * forever.
