/**
 * Combat-XP core, MC-free half: the per-hit XP formula pulled out of legacy
 * {@code CombatUtils#processCombatXP} and {@code runnables/skills/AwardCombatXpTask} so it is
 * server-free and unit-testable against the real bundled {@code experience.yml}. The MC-typed half —
 * resolving the victim's type, category and remaining health — is
 * {@link com.gmail.nossr50.platform.CombatUtils#processCombatXP}.
 *
 * <h2>Per-hit, not per-kill</h2>
 * mcMMO pays combat XP on <em>every hit</em>, proportional to the damage that hit actually lands:
 * {@code (int) (damage * base * 10 * multiplier)}. This port originally simplified that to a single
 * per-kill award on {@code AFTER_DEATH} (Phase 3) — the damage fractions across a mob's whole life sum
 * to its max health, so the totals matched for a clean solo kill. That simplification was reverted:
 * it structurally could not carry the per-hit multipliers Archery (fired-from distance, bow draw
 * force) and Taming (the wolf-assist ×3) are balanced around, and it silently paid nothing at all when
 * a wolf landed the killing blow.
 *
 * <p>Legacy measured the damage indirectly, by scheduling {@code AwardCombatXpTask} for the next tick
 * and diffing the victim's health across it, because a Bukkit event handler could not know what the
 * hit would finally land. This port sits on the {@code modifyAppliedDamage} seam <em>inside</em>
 * {@code damage()}, holding the post-armor figure that is about to be written, so the diff is
 * unnecessary and both of that task's guards collapse into {@link #creditableDamage} directly.
