/**
 * Static helpers backing the Axes skill. Port note (Phase 10.3): only the Axe Mastery bonus-damage
 * math survives — it is pure config + rank arithmetic and therefore provable without a server.
 *
 * <p>The critical-hit / impact / greater-impact / skull-splitter modifier statics stay dropped: each
 * was only a cached config read, and their combat bodies (now live — see {@link AxesManager}) read
 * the config directly at the point of use, like the Axe Mastery multiplier below.
 *
 * <p>Config statics were made live reads (was {@code static final} inited at class-load): the
 * service-locator config is installed after class load, so cached statics were fragile — same call
 * the ported {@code Archery} makes.
