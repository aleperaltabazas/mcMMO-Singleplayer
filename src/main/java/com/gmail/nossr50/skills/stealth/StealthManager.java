/**
 * Stealth — the rogue skill. XP comes from horizontal distance covered while sneaking; the payoff is
 * moving faster while crouched (Padfoot), hitting harder out of stealth (Assassin), and a cooldowned
 * vanishing act (Smoke Bomb).
 *
 * <p><b>MC-free by construction</b>, like every other manager: the platform layer decides what state
 * the player is in and this class owns the arithmetic and the gates, so all of it is unit-testable.
 *
 * <h2>Relationship to Agility</h2>
 * Stealth is a standalone primary skill, <em>not</em> a fourth Agility movement domain (ruled
 * 2026-07-25) — its payoff is not-being-seen rather than locomotion. Three seams still touch
 * Agility, and each is settled deliberately rather than by luck:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>XP never double-pays.</b> Agility's medium classifier returns "no medium" for a sneaking
 *       player, in every medium, so a tick of travel feeds exactly one of the two skills. Sneaking
 *       is Stealth's sensor and crouched travel pays Agility nothing.</li>
 *   <li><b>Padfoot and Fleet Footed cannot both be live</b>, for the same reason — and post-2026-07-27
 *       they no longer even contend for an attribute: Fleet Footed's land body is
 *       {@code movement_speed} while Padfoot is {@code sneaking_speed}, a separate vanilla attribute
 *       that only applies while crouched or crawling. D-AG5 resolves to "structurally impossible"
 *       rather than "carefully avoided".</li>
 *   <li><b>Assassin and Agility's Smash are mutually exclusive states</b> — you cannot sprint and
 *       sneak at once — so the two combat bonuses can never stack. Intended, not accidental.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Not shipped in v1</h2>
 * <b>Thief</b> (mobs notice you less while sneaking) is deferred, not disabled: it needs a mixin on
 * mob target selection, and there is no enum constant, config key or locale string for it. Adding a
 * dead sub-skill would make {@code /mcstats} advertise a mechanic that does nothing.
