/**
 * An immutable snapshot of Stealth's sneak-XP tuning.
 *
 * <p>Stealth pays per <em>second</em> of qualifying sneak-travel, with each tick's distance clamped
 * at the sneak reference speed — the same model Agility's movement domains use, applied through the
 * shared {@link SpeedNormalisedXp}. It is not merely consistency for its own sake: Stealth has the
 * self-levelling feedback loop in a sharper form than Agility does. {@link StealthManager Padfoot}
 * raises the {@code sneaking_speed} attribute from its vanilla {@code 0.3} toward {@code 1.0}, so a
 * maxed Padfoot player covers ground <b>more than three times</b> faster than an unranked one —
 * against Fleet Footed's 20%. Paying per block would make Padfoot a 3.3× XP multiplier on itself.
 *
 * <p>Under the clamp a maxed Padfoot player earns the same XP per <em>second</em> as a beginner and
 * simply covers more ground doing it. That is the intended reward: the sub-skill saves you time, it
 * does not print XP.
 *
 * <p>Where the numbers come from, so nobody has to re-derive them:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #DEFAULT_SNEAK_REFERENCE_SPEED} is vanilla walk speed (≈4.317 b/s) times the
 *       {@code sneaking_speed} attribute's default of {@code 0.3} — bytecode-verified from
 *       {@code EntityAttributes}, where it is a {@code ClampedEntityAttribute(0.3, 0.0, 1.0)}. The
 *       0.3 factor is exact; the walk speed is the conventional figure and is still a §G
 *       measurement item.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #DEFAULT_BASELINE_XP_PER_SECOND} is picked from a time-to-max, not by feel:
 *       11,010,000 XP to RetroMode 1000 on the shipped linear curve, at 50 XP/s, is ≈61 hours of
 *       continuous sneaking. That is deliberately the fastest continuous earner in the mod and
 *       deliberately below the ≥80 h guardrail every other skill is held to (GitHub #6, ruled by
 *       the user; doubled from the original 25 XP/s ≈122 h). Sneaking halves your speed and demands
 *       constant attention, so it is priced for what it costs the player rather than by a guardrail
 *       that measures distance.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A snapshot rather than live config reads because it is consulted 20×/s per player — the
 * Alchemy Catalysis per-tick-config-read trap. {@link StealthManager} builds one lazily per player
 * session, which is exactly the lifetime of a loaded config.
