/**
 * The K7 Fishing hook: detects when a player reels in a catch. Vanilla fires no plain "catch" event
 * usable for mutation here — NeoForge's own {@code ItemFishedEvent} is a dead end for this purpose,
 * see the design doc's Mojang-Mapping Verification section — so this taps the one unambiguous seam
 * inside {@code FishingHook#retrieve} (the official-mapped rename of Fabric's {@code use}): the
 * {@code CriteriaTriggers.FISHING_ROD_HOOKED.trigger(player, rod, hook, caughtLoot)} call. Its fourth
 * argument is the caught-loot {@code Collection<ItemStack>}, so a {@link ModifyArg} on that argument
 * gives us the exact items with no local-variable capture (robust across mappings).
 *
 * <p>{@code retrieve} runs only server-side (it early-returns when the level is client or the owner
 * is null before any trigger call), so no client guard is needed here. The criterion also fires for
 * the reel-in-a-hooked-entity branch, but there vanilla passes {@code Collections.emptyList()} — the
 * listener treats an empty collection as a no-op.
 *
 * <p>The fourth argument is the very same {@code List} that {@code retrieve} then iterates to spawn
 * the reeled-in item entities and orbs (bytecode-verified against the patched source: the criterion
 * call and the spawn loop both read the one local {@code list} variable), so the listener may mutate
 * it in place to inject a Treasure Hunter reward — that reward then flies to the player exactly like
 * a normal catch. We return the (possibly mutated) collection; mutating it also lets the criterion
 * see the reward, a harmless advancement-trigger deviation.
 *
 * <p><b>The second injector is the Shake seam</b> (legacy's {@code CAUGHT_ENTITY} state). Bytecode
 * verified: within {@code retrieve} there is exactly one {@code this.pullEntity(this.hookedIn)} call,
 * on the {@code this.hookedIn != null} branch — injecting there is both unambiguous and faithfully
 * ordered: CraftBukkit fired {@code PlayerFishEvent} <i>before</i> performing the pull, so mcMMO's
 * shake runs first there too. The hooked entity is read back through the public
 * {@code getHookedIn()} (still set at this point; only {@code remove} clears it), which keeps the
 * mixin free of local capture. (A second {@code pullEntity(this.hookedIn)} call exists in
 * {@code handleEntityEvent}, client-side only — irrelevant here since this injector is scoped to
 * {@code retrieve}.)
 *
 * <p><b>The third injector is the Ice Fishing seam</b> (legacy's {@code IN_GROUND} state). Modern
 * vanilla has no such bobber state — it was a CraftBukkit synthesis fired when a player reeled a
 * bobber resting on solid ground — so this taps the {@code HEAD} of the same {@code retrieve} reel
 * method and lets the listener reconstruct the precondition (no hooked entity, and the hook is not
 * in water). A plain non-cancelling inject: the reel proceeds and discards the hook as normal; the
 * only side effect is melting the ice sheet the player is looking at into a fishing hole. See
 * {@link FishingListener#tryIceFishing}.
 *
 * <p><b>The fourth injector is the Treasure Hunter vanilla-XP-boost seam</b> (legacy's
 * {@code event.setExpToDrop(...)} on {@code PlayerFishEvent}). Vanilla builds the orb inline in
 * {@code retrieve}'s loot loop as
 * {@code new ExperienceOrb(player.level(), player.getX(), player.getY() + 0.5, player.getZ() + 0.5,
 * this.random.nextInt(6) + 1)}, so the amount is the 5th constructor argument (index 4 of
 * {@code (Level, D, D, D, I)}) — modifying it is exactly equivalent to overwriting Bukkit's
 * {@code expToDrop} before the orb is spawned.
 *
 * <p>Bytecode-verified: that constructor is invoked exactly once in {@code retrieve}, hence
 * {@code allow = 1} on the last injector — an unconstrained injector here would silently bind to any
 * future orb spawn added to the method.
 *
 * <p>The overfishing punishment empties the loot collection, so this loop body never runs for a
 * confiscated catch and the orb is never spawned, as intended.
