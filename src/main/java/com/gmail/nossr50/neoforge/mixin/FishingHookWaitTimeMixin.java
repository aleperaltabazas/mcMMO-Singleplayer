/**
 * The Master Angler seam: shortens how long a hook waits for a bite. Replaces legacy's
 * {@code MasterAnglerTask}, which ran a tick after the Bukkit {@code PlayerFishEvent} and mutated
 * the {@code FishHook} through {@code setMinWaitTime}/{@code setMaxWaitTime}/{@code setApplyLure} —
 * none of which vanilla exposes.
 *
 * <p><b>The seam.</b> Bytecode-verified against the patched source,
 * {@code FishingHook#catchingFish} (the official-mapped rename of Fabric's
 * {@code tickFishingLogic}) ends with the <i>only</i> place a fresh wait is drawn:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * this.timeUntilLured = Mth.nextInt(this.random, 100, 600);
 * this.timeUntilLured = this.timeUntilLured - this.lureSpeed;
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Those hardcoded {@code 100}/{@code 600} are exactly what Bukkit's {@code FishHook#getMinWaitTime}
 * / {@code getMaxWaitTime} returned by default, so redirecting this one call gives us legacy's three
 * API calls at once: the redirect receives vanilla's own bounds (nothing hardcoded here), draws from
 * the mcMMO-reduced range instead, and — since the reduction was already folded into the max-wait
 * bonus — adds {@code lureSpeed} back so the subtraction on the next line cancels out. That add-back
 * <i>is</i> legacy's {@code setApplyLure(false)}, which existed to dodge a Minecraft bug where Lure
 * above level 3 breaks fishing.
 *
 * <p>{@code catchingFish} casts the level to {@code ServerLevel} on its first line, so it is
 * server-only and needs no client guard. The redirect is anchored with a {@link Slice} starting at
 * the {@code 600} constant rather than by ordinal — {@code catchingFish} makes two other
 * {@code Mth.nextInt} calls (bytecode-verified: {@code (20, 40)} for the nibble timer and
 * {@code (20, 80)} for the hook timer) and we must not touch those.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code allow = 1} is load-bearing, not decoration.</b> An unconstrained redirect here would
 * silently hijack the nibble and hook countdowns as well, corrupting vanilla fishing timings for
 * everyone — see {@code defaultRequire = 1} in {@code mcmmo.mixins.json}, which turns an unexpected
 * binding count into a loud startup failure. Any future slice-anchored injector in this mod wants the
 * same guard.
 *
 * <p><b>Deviation from legacy (documented):</b> legacy applied Master Angler once per cast; this
 * fires on every wait redraw, so a cast that cycles through several bite windows keeps the bonus
 * instead of reverting to vanilla timings after the first. The gates are also read at draw time
 * rather than at cast time, so swapping the rod out mid-cast changes the next wait.
