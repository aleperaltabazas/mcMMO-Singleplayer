/**
 * Reads and writes a mob's {@link MobOrigin} — the Minecraft-typed half of Hunter's D-HU1 anti-farm
 * gate. {@link MobOrigin} owns the vocabulary and the "does it count" predicate; this owns the mapping
 * from vanilla's {@link MobSpawnType} and the attachment access.
 *
 * <h2>The seam: whatever carries the spawn reason on this version</h2>
 * The plan implied {@code MobEntity#initialize(ServerWorldAccess, LocalDifficulty, MobSpawnType,
 * EntityData)}, which is where both spawner logics hand a reason to a freshly built mob. <b>It is not
 * safe on any version.</b> {@code CaveSpiderEntity} overrides {@code initialize} with a bare
 * {@code return entityData} that deliberately skips {@code SpiderEntity}'s jockey logic and never
 * calls {@code super} — so a mixin there misses cave spiders entirely, and a mineshaft cave-spider
 * spawner is one of the two or three most-built grinders in the game.
 *
 * <p>Where vanilla funnels every creation through <b>one</b> factory that carries the reason
 * ({@code EntityType#create(World, MobSpawnType)}), that factory is the seam and one injector covers
 * everything: it is an instance method on {@code EntityType}, a class with no vanilla subclasses, so
 * no mob can override it, and it ignores its own {@code MobSpawnType} parameter, so reading the reason
 * there perturbs nothing.
 *
 * <h2>&#128273;&#128273; Where that funnel does not exist, ONE injector is a TRAP</h2>
 * On versions without it the reason-carrying entry points do <b>not</b> converge, verified against the
 * merged jar:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code MobSpawnerLogic}/{@code TrialSpawnerLogic} reach
 *       {@code EntityType.loadEntityWithPassengers(NbtCompound, World, Function)}, which <b>takes no
 *       {@code MobSpawnType} at all</b> — the spawner's own {@code MobSpawnType.SPAWNER} goes only to
 *       {@code canSpawn} and {@code initialize}, never to entity creation</li>
 *   <li>{@code AnimalEntity#breed} reaches {@code createChild} → {@code EntityType.create(World)} —
 *       also no reason</li>
 *   <li>only spawn eggs, dispensers and portals reach
 *       {@code create(ServerWorld, Consumer, BlockPos, MobSpawnType, boolean, boolean)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>That last method exists on those versions, so retargeting to it BINDS</b> — the mixin audit
 * goes green while spawner-farmed and bred mobs are silently left unmarked. That is strictly worse
 * than an injector that resolves to nothing, because a dead injector is at least loud. So on those
 * versions the stamp is split per origin, one injector at each real spawn site, and
 * {@link #stampOnSpawn(Entity, MobSpawnType)} is the entry they share.
 *
 * <h2>Never write a qualifying origin</h2>
 * {@link #stampOnSpawn} returns without touching the entity when the reason maps to
 * {@link MobOrigin#NATURAL}. That is required, not tidy: some spawn reasons re-introduce a mob that
 * <em>already carries a marker</em> — restored from a previous session, or arriving from the far
 * side of a portal — and a write here would erase it. Which reasons those are is version-specific
 * and some do not exist on every supported version; the invariant that does not change is
 * <b>never write a qualifying origin</b>. See {@code McMMOAttachments#MOB_ORIGIN}.
