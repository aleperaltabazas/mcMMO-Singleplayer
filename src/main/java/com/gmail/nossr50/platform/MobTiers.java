/**
 * Resolves a creature's Hunter tier — the Minecraft-typed half of D-HU5. {@link HunterManager} owns
 * the rule and the exception lookup; this owns the three reads the rule needs, and the decision about
 * <em>where</em> to read them from.
 *
 * <p>Structured exactly like {@link MobOrigins}, for the same reason: the vocabulary and the
 * arithmetic stay unit-testable without a world, and everything that needs a Minecraft type lives in
 * one small class.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ The stats come from the ENTITY TYPE, never from the entity that died</h2>
 * {@link DefaultAttributeRegistry} holds each type's base attribute container. Reading the live
 * victim's {@code getMaxHealth()} / {@code getAttributeValue(ATTACK_DAMAGE)} instead would be both
 * wrong and unstable:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Equipment counts toward the live value.</b> A zombie that spawned holding an iron sword
 *       carries that sword's modifier on its own {@code ATTACK_DAMAGE}, so it would out-rank an
 *       identical bare-handed zombie. Tier is a property of the <em>species</em>, not of the
 *       individual, and a player must be able to learn it.</li>
 *   <li><b>Several mobs roll their health on spawn.</b> {@code HorseEntity#initialize} picks a value
 *       from a range; the type's base is a single fixed number.</li>
 *   <li><b>Difficulty and potion effects move the live value</b>, and a hard-mode zombie is not a
 *       different creature.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Modded mobs are covered for free: Fabric's {@code FabricDefaultAttributeRegistry} writes into
 * this same registry, so a modded creature is read exactly like a vanilla one.
 *
 * @see <a href="file:../../../../../../../plans/new-skills/hunter.md">plans/new-skills/hunter.md</a>
